        "Assume we have a bunch of pictures of human faces (M different pictures), all in the same pixel dimension (e.g., all are r×c grayscale images). We can put all the picture pixel in a matrix with M columns , where each column has all rxc pixels of one picture stacked below each other in one vector.\n",

        "Recall that principal component analysis (PCA) can be applied to any matrix, and the result is a number of vectors called the principal components. The various principal components constructed a vector space for which each column in the matrix ( or equivalently each picture) can be represented as a linear combination (i.e., weighted sum) of the principal components.\n",

        ", is that they are the key directions that we can construct the columns of matrix\n",
        ". The relative importance of the different principal component vectors can be inferred from the corresponding eigenvalues. The greater the eigenvalue, the more useful (i.e., holds more information about\n",
        ") the principal component vector. Hence we can keep only the most important principal component vectors. If matrix\n",
        " is the dataset for face pictures, the first K principal component vectors are the top K most important “face pictures”. We call them the eigenface picture.\n",
        "\n",
        "For any given face picture, we can project its mean-subtracted version onto the eigenface picture using vector dot-product. The result is how close this face picture is related to the eigenface. If the face picture is totally unrelated to the eigenface, we would expect its result is zero. For the K eigenfaces, we can find K dot-product for any given face picture. We can present the result as weights of this face picture with respect to the eigenfaces. The weight is usually presented as a vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conversely, if we have a weight vector, we can add up each eigenfaces subjected to the weight and reconstruct a new face. Let’s denote the eigenfaces as matrix\n",

        "\n",
        "Since the eigenface matrix is constant for the dataset, a varying weight vector\n",
        " means a varying face picture. Therefore we can expect the pictures of the same person would provide similar weight vectors, even if the pictures are not identical. As a result, we may make use of the distance between two weight vectors (such as the L2-norm) as a metric of how two pictures resemble.\n"
