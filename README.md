# Eigenface-for-Facial-Recognition
This was my linear algebra project it applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to facial recognition. It constructs a vector space using principal components (eigenvectors of the covariance matrix) from face images. This allows representing and identifying faces as linear combinations of these "eigenfaces" for efficient matching
